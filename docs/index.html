            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>ataqv is a toolkit for measuring and visualizing your
                ATAC-seq results. We wrote it to help us understand
                how well our ATAC-seq assays had worked, and to make
                it easier to spot differences that might be caused by
                library prep or sequencing.</p>

            <h1>Documentation</h1>
            <p>The online documentation is currently all in the <a href="https://github.com/ParkerLab/ataqv/">GitHub project README</a>.</p>

            <h1>Example</h1>
            <p>We've generated an instance of the <code>ataqv</code> results viewer, stocked with data from the original ATAC-seq paper. You can check it out <a href="demo/index.html">here</a>, and if you'd like to compare it to your own results, you can either download each file individually from the demo, or clone <a href="https://github.com/ParkerLab/ataqv/">the ataqv Git repository</a> and add to your <code>mkarv</code> command the JSON files you want from the <code>docs/demo/data/</code> subdirectory.</p>
